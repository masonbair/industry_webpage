INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP SEMINAR  
SPEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS

The objective of this seminar is to expose our students to the variety of experiences in the computer science and IT industries. This will help them select and prepare for their future careers. Thank you for agreeing to help us with this!

A 30–45 minute presentation is expected. Slides are helpful but not necessary—simple is best.

Below are suggested topics and an outline for your presentation. Please treat these as suggestions: anything and everything about your experience is interesting! If you choose to spend the entire presentation on your favorite programming language or a particular topic, feel free to do so. Please do not share any non-public information.

Rather than giving direct advice (e.g., "study hard"), explain why, share stories from your work that support your advice, and discuss your personal experiences.

**Suggested Topics/Outline**

- **About yourself:**  
  Your college experience, career highlights, how you chose to become a computer science professional, and why you work for your current company.

- **About your company:**  
  Name, products and processes, number of employees, number of IT professionals, and anything interesting or unusual that students should know.

- **About your work:**  
  - Challenging or interesting projects  
  - Human interactions: with your supervisor, colleagues, and customers

- **Tools of the trade:**  
  What computer languages, tools, and processes you use at work (and how), and which ones you wish you used.

- **Job/internship opportunities:**  
  Opportunities at your company and how to pursue them.

- **The future:**  
  Where do you see the industry going in the next 1–5 years?

- **Advice to students:**  
  What courses to take, what to do in college, how to prepare a resume, what companies to choose, what opportunities to pursue, and how to get them.
