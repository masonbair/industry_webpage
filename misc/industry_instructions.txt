INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP SEMINAR SPEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS

The objective of the seminar is to expose our students to the variety
of computer science and IT related industry experiences. This would
help them in selecting their future career and help them prepare for
it.  Thank you agreeing to help us with this!

30-45 minute presentation is expected. Slides are helpful but not
necessary. Simple does it.

Here are the suggested topics and the outline of the presentation at the
seminar. Please treat this as a suggestion: anything and everything is
interesting. If you choose to spend the whole presentation on your
favorite programming language or somesuch, by all means do so. Do not
share any non-public information.

Rather than giving direct advice, e.g. "study hard" (students tend not
to be receptive to those), explain why, give stories from work that
support your advice, discuss your personal experience.


TOPICS/OUTLINE

- about yourself: your college experience, your career highlights, how
  you chose to be a computer science professional and why you
  work for the company you do now;

- about your company: name, products and processes, number of
  employees, number of IT professionals. Anything interesting and
  unusual that the students need to know;

- about your work:
  -- challenging or interesting projects,
  -- human interactions: with your supervisor, colleagues, customers;

- tools of the trade: what computer languages, tools, processes
  you use at work (and how) and which ones you wish you did;

- job/internship opportunities in your company and how to get them;

- what future holds: where do you see industry going in the next 1-5 years?

- advice to students: what courses to take, what to do in college, how
  to prepare the resume, what companies to chose, what opportunities to
  pursue and how to get them.

  What would you have done differently? Or maybe, what have you done right?
